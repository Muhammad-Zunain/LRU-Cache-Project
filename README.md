****LRU Cache Implementation :****

This is a simple implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. LRU cache is a type of cache that keeps track of the usage of data and discards the least recently used items first when the cache reaches its capacity.

****Features:****

LRU Replacement Policy: Implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy.
Get and Put Operations: Supports basic get(key) and put(key, value) operations.
Capacity Management: Automatically evicts the least recently used items when the cache reaches its capacity.
Thread-Safe: Provides thread-safe operations to handle concurrent access.
