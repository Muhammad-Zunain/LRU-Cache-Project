# LRU Cache Visualization ‚Äì Python GUI Project

An interactive implementation and visualization of an **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache** using **Python** with **CustomTkinter** GUI. This project showcases how LRU cache works internally using a doubly linked list and a dictionary ‚Äî suitable for educational demos, system design interviews, and algorithmic exploration.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates and visualizes:
- Real-time **cache operations (get/put)**
- **Hit/miss tracking**
- Cache capacity handling with **eviction policy**
- Internal **doubly linked list updates**
- Terminal + optional GUI (CustomTkinter) feedback

It is built using clean **OOP design**, and demonstrates how LRU caches are built from scratch without using `OrderedDict` or `functools.lru_cache()`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How LRU Works in This Project

- Uses a **DoublyLinkedList** to track the order of access.
- Uses a **Python dictionary** for O(1) access to cache entries.
- On `get(key)`:
  - If hit: moves the node to the front (MRU position)
  - If miss: returns -1 and records a miss
- On `put(key, value)`:
  - If key exists: updates value and moves to front
  - If not:
    - Inserts at front
    - If capacity exceeded: evicts **tail node** (LRU)

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI & Terminal Output

- `CustomTkinter` can be used to visually show:
  - Cache hits/misses
  - Current cache state as a list
  - Stats (total access, miss rate)
- Console version prints cache states and logs in clear format
